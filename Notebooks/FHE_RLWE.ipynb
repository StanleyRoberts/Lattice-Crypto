    "We explicitly import every function we use rather than rely on the Sagemath interpreter, this allows modularity with other files without having to manually preparse our .sage files. For this reason we also do not use Sagemath specific syntax (Such as diamond brackets) as this would throw off the Python syntax checker if we don't preparse the file. This allows smoother utilisation of this module, especially when using it in another notebook. Note that this code would run independantly perfectly fine without these imports as Sagemath will preparse the code automatically.\n"
